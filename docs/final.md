## Information Problem
There is a large selection of currently media avaialable on streaming services leading to Information Overload. This project seeks to solve this problem with a simple web application aimed at users seeking a movie to watch. Decision-making and discovery is hindered by information overload due to the sheer amount of content over multiple platforms. With this application the time spent deciding which movie to watch can be reduced with an easy to use quiz focusing on the user's mood. The ultimate goal of the application is to ease information overload with a lightwweight application to quickly recommend movies targeted by mood and preferences of the user.

## Data
* Database containing info on movies

## Strategies and Solutions

## Technical System Decision

## Has the Problem Been Addressed?

## Challenges
* We realized that we needed to change APIâ€™s from The Open Movie Database to The Movie Database
    * The first API did not have all the functionality that we wanted
    * Could only search for by name of the movie or movie ID
    * Did not have many methods
* Struggled to connect to API and struggled to apply certain resources we had
* Had to rework the quiz questions in order to simplify data that we were able to work with (changed from a text-entry to a checkbox)
    * Limitations of the new API such as only being able to search by individual years and actors requiring IDs
    * Struggled to balance between functionality of our application and how it looked on the frontend

## Future Work
* Display more metadata on each movie
* Provide a cleaner and more visually attractive front-end for users
