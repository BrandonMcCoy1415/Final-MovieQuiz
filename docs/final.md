## Information Problem
There is a large selection of currently media avaialable on streaming services leading to Information Overload. This project seeks to solve this problem with a simple web application aimed at users seeking a movie to watch. Decision-making and discovery is hindered by information overload due to the sheer amount of content over multiple platforms. With this application the time spent deciding which movie to watch can be reduced with an easy to use quiz focusing on the user's mood. The ultimate goal of the application is to ease information overload with a lightwweight application to quickly recommend movies targeted by mood and preferences of the user. 

## Targets
### Browsers
* Chrome 87
* Firefox 83 
* Safari 14

### Stakeholders

The primary stakeholders include users of streaming services including but not limited to:
* Amazon Prime Video
* Disney+
* HBO Max
* Hulu
* Netflix

These streaming services themselves are also identified as stakeholders in that they provide the content users will engage with. [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org) serves as a stakeholder as they are providing the database being accessed by this web application.

## Data
The data is retrived from a database of movies, TV shows and actor images provided by The Movie Database (TMDb). This application uses movie data to deliver results after sorting for the following features:
* Genre
* Year of Release
* Language
* Rating

This information is retrieved based on user input in the quiz with the following relationships (quiz feature -> database feature):
* Mood -> Genre
* Decade of Release -> Year of Release
* Language -> Language
* Age of Watchers -> Rating


### API
This project used The Movie Database (TMDb) API
* https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction

### Libraries
The application utilizes the The Movie DB (javascript library)

## Strategies and Solutions

The goal was to provide a lighweight solution so a simple interface was designed. The quiz serves to make decision-making easy by relating mood and preference to movie features. To achieve this the team needed an easy-to-implement frontend design. This was solved using HTML and CSS to provide a simple interface for users to interact with. In order to deliver results the application needed to connect to a database of movies in order to sort movies by certain features. JavaScript and JQuery were implemented to solve this. The API was chosen as it provided the features needed to interact with our application and included a library that achieved the strategies we wanted to implement. 

## Technical System Decisions
### Frontend
HTML is used for application structure and application design. This was done as it was simple to implement and achieved the functionailty the team desired.

CSS is implemented for website styles and presentation. Making use of flex ensured that the application could be used on multiple screens with simple design of the frontend user experience.

### Backend
JavaScript is used to handle frontend user input and information retrieval from the API. The application runs scripts from the themoviedb-javascript-library are run to retrieve information from the database based on user clicks. 

The library utilizes JQuery for this purpose to sort and match metadata within the database to deliver results to the user. 

## Has the Problem Been Addressed?
The problem has not been fully addressed with this application yet. Limitations of the database do not provide as many matches as could be available with a more robust option. The application currently does not provide detailed metadata delivered to the frontend which would help users in the decision-making process. As the solution targeted streaming platforms, more information on where movies can be watched could be provided to reduce information overload. The application in its current state successfully provides recommendations to users but adds more information seeking burden on the users to research titles further.

## Challenges
* We realized that we needed to change APIâ€™s from The Open Movie Database to The Movie Database
    * The first API did not have all the functionality that we wanted
    * Could only search for by name of the movie or movie ID
    * Did not have many methods
* Struggled to connect to API and struggled to apply certain resources we had
* Had to rework the quiz questions in order to simplify data that we were able to work with
    * Changed from a text-entry to a checkbox
    * Limitations of the new API such as only being able to search by individual years and actors requiring IDs
    * Struggled to balance between functionality of our application and how it looked on the frontend

## Future Work
Should the work continue we have identified key features to be implemented in the future. These serve as recommendations for other teams to make improvements as well. Other libraries and API's may be avaialble to provide better satisficing in frontend design and efficiency in the backend. A more robust database is recommended for better results.

* Features
    * Note where movies can be watched via streaming
    * Provide similar movies to results to allow more discovery
    * Display more metadata on each movie

* Recommended Improvements
    * Provide a cleaner and more visually attractive front-end for users
    * Add more variables for users to select to provide more specific recommendations
    * Allow more recommendations per result.
