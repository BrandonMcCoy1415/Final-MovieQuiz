## Strategies and Solutions

## Technical System Decision

## Has the Problem Been Addressed?

## Challenges
* We realized that we needed to change APIâ€™s from The Open Movie Database to The Movie Database
    * The first API did not have all the functionality that we wanted
    * Could only search for by name of the movie or movie ID
    * Did not have many methods
* Struggled to connect to API and struggled to apply certain resources we had
* Had to rework the quiz questions in order to simplify data that we were able to work with (changed from a text-entry to a checkbox)
    * Limitations of the new API such as only being able to search by individual years and actors requiring IDs
    * Struggled to balance between functionality of our application and how it looked on the frontend

## Future Work
* Display more metadata on each movie
* Provide a cleaner and more visually attractive front-end for users
