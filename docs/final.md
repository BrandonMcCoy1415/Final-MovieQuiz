    # Technical system decision rationale

    # How/if your final system helps to address the problem

    # Challenges faced and impact on final design
        * We realized that we needed to change APIâ€™s from The Open Movie Database to The Movie Database
            * The first API did not have all the functionality that we wanted
            * Could only search for by name of the movie or movie ID
            * Did not have many methods
        * Struggled to connect to API and struggled to apply certain resources we had
        * Had to rework the quiz questions in order to simplify data that we were able to work with (changed from a text-entry to a checkbox)
            * Limitations of the new API such as only being able to search by individual years and actors requiring IDs
        * Struggled to balance between functionality of our application and how it looked on the frontend

    # Possible future work directions with this problem
        * Display more metadata on each movie
        * Provide a cleaner and more visually attractive front-end for users
